# CICD-howto

This repo contains a small howto guide for how to implement CICD with NSO using GitLab, as well as some example files that are used in that guide.

You can read the guide either [online](CICD.md) or by cloning the repo and going from there. There is `Makefile` that can build a few different output formats if you have pandoc installed.

Additional topics might be added to this guide, or expanded, if there is interest.

If you have comments either contact vleijon@cisco.com, or send a pull-request.
